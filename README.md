# AdventOfCode2020 :crab:
Solutions to all 25 AoC 2020 problems in Rust :crab:

This year I went all out and went up at `5:50` every single day to do the puzzles (except day 5 when I overslept :cry:). I tried to aim for relatively high scores on the leaderboard (and got as high as [116 on day 20](./src/bin/20.rs)!). Solved most problems in less than one hour. This year was really cool but a lot easier than 2019.

See [notes.md](./notes.md) for some thoughts I wrote down after completing each day.

Thanks for another amazing year of AoC [@ericwastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) :christmas_tree:
