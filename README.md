# AdventOfCode2020 :crab:
Solutions to all 25 AoC 2020 problems in Rust :crab:

This year I went all out and went up at `5:50` every single day (except day 5 when I overslept :cry:) to do the puzzles. I tried to aim for relatively high scores on the leaderboard and got as high as [116 on day 20](./src/bin/20.rs), however competing against Python with Rust is difficult. Solved most problems in less than one hour though, and consistently hit top 1000 on a lot of the problems. This year was cool but _a lot_ easier than 2019.

See [notes.md](./notes.md) for some thoughts I wrote down after completing each day.

Thanks for another amazing year of AoC [@ericwastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) :christmas_tree:
