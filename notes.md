# Notes
This is my thoughts I wrote down after I completed each challenge.

## Day 01 - [link](./src/bin/01.rs)
It's december again, finally! So excited to do this again this year. Thought about maybe doing it in F# this year but decided against it. Rust again it is!

Very easy problem of course since it's day 1. Servers crashed just when I was about to submit! I think I got lucky because after a while I managed to submit my answer, and I got 54th place IN THE WORLD!!!

Solved using a double and triple for loop. Later cleaned it up and used `tuple-combinations` from the `itertools` crate. So both a fast (`1ms`) and clean solution.

Edit: They later removed the leaderboards for day 1 since it was unfair, which makes sense. Still though!
